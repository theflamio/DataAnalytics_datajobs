# Airflow Pipeline Project Description

## Introduction
This portfolio project involves the development of an Airflow pipeline for fetching data from Kaggle using a dataset provided by Luke Barousse. Before delving into the details, it's essential to extend gratitude to Luke Barousse for the dataset provision. Thank you, Luke!

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Apache Airflow. The dataset provided by Luke Barousse on Kaggle will serve as the source for this pipeline. The data will be fetched, processed, and loaded into a PostgreSQL database.

## Pipeline Components
### 1. Data Fetching
- **Source**: Kaggle Dataset provided by Luke Barousse
- **Method**: Utilize Kaggle API or direct download to fetch the dataset.
- **Description**: This component fetches the required dataset from Kaggle. 

### 2. Data Transformation
- **Processing**: Cleaning, Transformation, and Preprocessing.
- **Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, etc.
- **Description**: Perform necessary transformations on the raw data to prepare it for loading into the database. This may include handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.

### 3. Data Loading
- **Destination**: PostgreSQL Database
- **Tool**: SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2, etc.
- **Description**: Load the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database for storage and further analysis.

## Pipeline Automation
The project will implement a fully automated pipeline using Apache Airflow. Airflow will orchestrate and schedule the execution of pipeline tasks.

### 1. DAG Definition
- Define a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that outlines the workflow of the pipeline.
- Specify the tasks and their dependencies within the DAG.

### 2. Task Execution
- Configure individual tasks to execute specific functions, such as data fetching, transformation, and loading.
- Define task dependencies to ensure proper execution order.

### 3. Scheduling
- Set up scheduling intervals for the pipeline to run periodically, ensuring that data updates are processed efficiently.

## Testing
Comprehensive testing will be conducted to validate the functionality and reliability of the pipeline.

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual components of the pipeline to ensure they perform as expected.
- Validate data transformations and database loading processes.

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test the entire pipeline end-to-end to verify seamless integration between components.
- Confirm data consistency and accuracy throughout the pipeline.

## Deployment
The pipeline will be deployed to a production environment for continuous operation.

### 1. Environment Setup
- Configure the necessary infrastructure, including servers and databases, for pipeline deployment.

### 2. Deployment Automation
- Implement automation scripts for seamless deployment of the pipeline to the production environment.

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Set up monitoring tools to track pipeline performance and detect any issues.
- Establish procedures for regular maintenance and updates to ensure the pipeline's reliability and efficiency.

## Integration with PowerBI
After data has been loaded into the PostgreSQL database, it will be integrated with PowerBI for data visualization and insights generation regarding data science jobs.

### Data Visualization
- Utilize PowerBI's interactive dashboards and visualizations to provide insights into various aspects of data science jobs, such as job trends, salary analysis, and geographical distribution.

### Insights Generation
- Leverage PowerBI's analytical capabilities to derive valuable insights from the data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions regarding data science job markets.

## Conclusion
This portfolio project showcases the development of an Airflow pipeline for ETL processes, fetching data from Kaggle and loading it into a PostgreSQL database. By automating the pipeline, it enables efficient data processing and analysis while maintaining data integrity and reliability. Special thanks to Luke Barousse for providing the dataset.
